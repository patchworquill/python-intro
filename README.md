<h1>Patchwork's Python Process</h1>

Wassup y'all, I made this for a few friends who, during the COVID-19 isolation period, are getting started with learning Python. I've used the following tools lately, and find it's my favourite process + toolkit for working with Python.

<h2>Install Atom, a great and hackable text editor</h2>
https://atom.io/
<p>First off, you're going to want a good text editor. Atom is basically a full IDE (integrated development environment), but it is super lightweight and you can expand it with modules/packages to give additional functions like auto-complete, Markdown Preview, HTML Preview, RhinoPython, SpellCheck, GitHub, Git Diff, and Hydrogen -- more info about that to follow. </p>

<h2>Install hydrogen</h2>
https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen
Hydrogen adds jupyter-style notebook functionality to the atom editor!. This is amazing, you can run python lines directly in the editor and see outputs.

<h2>Install pyenv</h2>
Mac:

This helps, ensuring so you are working with the correct version of Python, without messing with your computer's system version of Python, which is used for background stuff that you really don't want to break.

Windows:
https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win


<h2>Optional: install zsh</h2>

Get your terminal working for you, not against you.
